## Network analysis

This folder contains resources for doing a network analysis. Network analysis can be useful both in planning investigations (mapping networks and identifying actors within that) and storytelling (showing patterns or allowing users to explore networks).

You can find [my bookmarks on various things related to network analysis here](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis). Add extra tags to drill down further, e.g. [https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis+tools](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis+tools) shows tools that I have bookmarked.
