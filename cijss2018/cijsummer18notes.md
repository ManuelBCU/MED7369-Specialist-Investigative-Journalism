BuzzFeed:
* 1 in 5 millennials use it
* 60 percent of 18-25 year olds worldwide
* 75% of traffic from social

20 reporters on investigations worldwide, which puts it at same scale as NYTimes.

Tom loves court documents - one of his areas, alongside data and FOI. Some judgements are verbal so you have to buy a transcript. PACER in the US is great - it puts all docs online - but in the UK you have to find people connected with the case and ask for docs. [Chaos at the National Crime Agency](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tomwarren/the-national-crime-agency-is-in-chaos-over-unlawful-raids?utm_term=.hbYYDG3Yd#.pvZ1vZa1Y) story was based on that.

> "I used to spend the weekends reading reports. In government reports there'll be 50 pages of dull stuff then a brief mention of something interesting you can chase up."

In US: Detective Guevara's witnesses - 8 people released from prison since.

FOI: Get the **information asset register** which details all the information held.

## NHS Shaun Lintern

Phonecall overhead by Shaun - he followed it up, and it led to Mid Staffordshire inquiry.

15% of OECD country hospital expenditure goes on treating safety failures

2m+ incidents reported to [National Reporting and Learning System](https://report.nrls.nhs.uk/nrlsreporting/) (NRLS) in 2016/17

Unsafe care costs NHS £1bn-£2.5bn

* NHS England - a commissioner which pays for services
* NHS Improvement -
* CQC - the check on what everyone else is doing

Example: **[Lizzie Dixon](https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/exclusive-cqc-to-review-care-for-newborns-following-babys-death/5089708.article)**, 2001. No system would touch the case. We highlighted it as a regulatory gap, a failure of the system to look into this case. We've since helped to pursue an independent inquiry. CQC: "Lessons to be learned". I got involved by talking to the mother. It's very easy to dismiss families when they call on the phone - it for me was just a case of letting someone talk.

Example: **Jonnie Meek**, 2014: had a reaction to milk feed and died. Was followed by attempts to prevent

**[Child Death Overview Panel](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/child-death-overview-panels-contacts)**: notes said he had had 3 cardiac arrests and been admitted to cardiac care - none of this was true. Statement said he died suddenly in mother's arms, when chase up: "She never made that statement".

Independent review after HSJ highlighted it. Solicitor General has backed family's request for an inquest. "Listen to the families"

Example: **Ken Godward**, 2015: attacked and killed in hospital bed; fellow patient tried to help and was also killed. Story was about how the attacker, Harry, had his medication stopped. That wasn't the focus of inquiries. Didn't come from the families but from a hospital whistleblower who felt families were being badly treated. Not much to go on, all I had was Ken's name. From that I was able to build a story via the coroner's court. They hadn't held an inquest more than 3 years after the incident, but...

We managed to persuade them to share one family's details on the basis that we were going to report a story and we wouldn't want that to come as a shock - would they pass on our details to alert them that we are doing a story? They got in touch.

Found another family through a charity which worked with families of people who had been killed by people with mental health conditions. Knew there was an advocate involved in the case and guessed it would be this charity. Already had a relationship from previous stories. Asked if family would want to speak to us.

Families were normally thrilled to be approached a journalist because they felt it needed to be told but hadn't thought to approach any reporter. Now going to be an inquest.

Coroners are extremely variable in their quality.

You need to spend time educating yourself, reading things. You have to know things, people, and what's going on.

Example: [Deputy ombudsman resigns](https://www.hsj.co.uk/workforce/termination-payment-to-former-deputy-ombudsman-revealed/7013299.article), [ombudsman resigns](https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/workforce/health-service-watchdog-resigns-over-cover-up/7006147.article)

CQC report - read the employment tribunal notes under that report - I read it. In the list of people criticised was the name of someone who had recently joined the health service ombudsman, Nick Martin. We went further to find out what did his boss know - turned out she had been warned twice that he had been criticised twice in employment tribunal for sexual harassment. So she resigned.

Knew I had to work under the **Public Inquiries Act** so I printed it out and read it so I knew what the powers were of the inquiry *and* the powers for people attending it, including journalists.

"**Evidence used must be made available for inspection by the public**"

As part of the inquiry a report was mentioned that we'd been previously refused. I used those rights to immediately ask the inquiry press officer for that report.

*Standards of surgery 'dangerous'* story came out of that.

Example: '*Huge leak reveals BMA plan to draw out junior doctors dispute*' based on cache of WhatsApp messages. About source development: my source at the BMA, relationship building, started with smaller stories

Example: shortage of nurses on wards. Got testimony from nurses on wards.

> "Data stories I believe always need to have humanity behind it. What are the characters behind it? I get so frustrated when they are just data stories."

Example: [Why are some babies dying in the NHS?](https://www.hsj.co.uk/policy-and-regulation/investigation-why-are-some-babies-dying-in-the-nhs/7018144.article)

* Trigger event = hypothesis. Seek knowledge.
* Explore issue. Is it a bigger wider prblem?
* Find the evidence. Long days and nights.
* Bring together with a narrative informed by experts and families
* Don't stop at the problem. Identify possible solutions or examples others can follow.

## Recipe for success:

* Contacts
* Knowledge
* Personal integrity
