# Undercover reporting - notes from a BBC investigations day

You are basically committing a crime in order to expose a bigger crime.

Biggest task is finding and training the people who are going to go undercover (example posing as students for international visa). We were looking for students who had a real passport and were plausible in terms of qualifications, other aspects of the story, etc.

You have to have evidence of wrongdoing first.

Have to get it checked off by editors, EdPol, and other senior people (deputy director of current affairs/controller of English Regions).

You need to plan carefully:

* Evidence you need to get
* Safety
* What you do if things go wrong
* How are you going to get them out if needed (how will they contact you if they're not comfortable) - "we had a text protocol"
* Safe place to start, close enough to target building but not so close that you are rumbled

You are expected to disclose crime to police "Within a reasonable amount of time". That will depend on the crime and likelihood of further crime, etc. - an editorial and legal/ethical discussion/decision.

Engage with BBC High Risk and talk through plan.

May have to give evidence at trial. May receive a **production order** from police to share film.

### Considerations:

Scenario 1: Students paying for someone else to do English language test

* Identification
* Discovery (e.g. kit)
* How far you push subject (incitement, conspiracy etc.) - witness with as little direct encouragement as possible
* Don't comment on camera as long as it's filming (even after leaving), in case rushes are requested
* Debrief after camera is turned off, but...
* Keep very good records

Scenario 2: Mosque where radicalisation is taking place.

* Very tough laws around this issue which need considering first (including duty to disclose)
* Consider position on production order - after filming has finished?
* Lawyers may advise that some information you will be obliged to disclose to authorities, so may be details you do not ask for to avoid that scenario
