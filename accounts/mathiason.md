# Nick Mathiason, Finance Uncovered: notes from BBC investigations day 2018

Different types of company:

* Unincorporated companies (freelancers, self employed)
* Trusts - a legal arrangement when one person gives ownership of an asset to another for the benefit of a third person. Can take various forms: charitable, discretionary, interest in possession
* Partnerships (John Lewis, law firms, accountants, architects)
* Limited liability partnerships (LLP) (hedge funds - no corporation tax, partners self-assess) - pay is disclosed, stories on bonuses, average pay etc.
* Limited partnerships (commanditaire vennootschap - Netherlands) - see [ICIJ on Nike](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/swoosh-owner-nike-stays-ahead-of-the-regulator-icij/)
* Limited liability company (LLC) - US, hybrid
* Limited company (U) Sarl (French speaking)
* And others...

Tax havens are not necessarily completely secretive - some information can be gleaned, sometimes there is a nominal cost involved.

### '10K' forms in the US

Directors in the US are more liable so more information is disclosed for listed companies.

Edgar system of SEC breaks down what they invest cash in.

For example: big tech companies had billions of dollars invested in treasury debt ("may be subject to tax if repatriated" = currently offshore) so taxpayers were paying interest on debt

### The Netherlands

Where developing countries' companies are typically registered. All Vodafone subsidiaries listed here.

## Accounts structure

Cashflow statement is often where journalists will look first, because it shows how much cash is on the books.

Going Concern statement is also worth looking at - See Bolton Wanderers statement for 2014 accounts for an example of reading between the lines ahead of a big crisis, "material uncertainty". [BHS is another example (see 2014)](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03858895/filing-history) (look at losses getting higher, costs of sales higher than turnover). On **balance sheet**, current liabilities show major debts too. **Stock** value has increased - another bad sign for a clothing company. **Cash at bank and in hand** decreasing. **Pension deficit** has also increased, as has the **liabilities** overall.

Oxfam too - allegations repeatedly [disclosed in its annual reports](http://www.oxfamannualreview.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/oxfam-annual-report-2016-17-v2.pdf).

Berkeley Housing pleaded poverty to avoid affordable housing target. But [their 2014 annual report](https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/media/pdf/0/l/berkeley-annual-report-2014.pdf) showed big profits (revenue minus cost of sales = gross profit. Divided by revenue, then times 100 = profit margin)

Compare with other builders in the sector to work out a typical margin. [Here's the story](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2016-11-27/builders-make-billions-as-housing-crisis-escalates)

Foxtons 2008 - massive increase in cash. How? Look at increase in bank loans and overdrafts.

Notes: [Aspers UK Holdings Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07262042/filing-history): see related party transactions. Note the high rates of interest on a loan from a sister company - a method of transferring money and avoiding tax.

[See story on tax avoidance here](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2016-05-11/the-house-always-wins-casino-giants-see-tax-savings-result-from-new-system-of-roulette-wheels)

Other methods: share sales, dividends, interest on shareholder loans, management fees, intellectual property charges. To resident country from source country

**Loans**: [story on Vodafone and African businesses](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/vodafone-wealthy-elites-mobile-phones-africa) - Mirambo Limited belonged to the campaign manager of a Tanzanian politician.

**Contingent liabilities**: where the icebergs are noted.
