Council gave £10m to Northampton Town for stadium but workers walked off site when money ran out.

Council gave money to special purpose vehicle (SPV) 1st Land, owned by Harold Grossman.

Council leader was David Mackintosh who went on to become Tory MP

One of co-founders of SPV involved in other odd companies. They thought this was a story but discovered he's a nominee director who just gets added to companies.

Tip off - look at electoral commission website and donors to David Mackintosh. 3 of the donors were the names of individuals related to the SPV. They were proxy donors from Harold Grossman.

So they'd established 3 bogus donations, breaking donation rules. [That was one story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-36055614).

We were then on course for a court case between council and 1st Land. This meant documents would be made available: £1m from the money went on 'consultancy fees', for example.

They obtained documents from High Court - duplicated them - so they could use them in reporting, covered by **qualified privilege**.

Second big story (*Inside Out*) was a narrative of what had happened to the money, and this High Court case.

When company went into administration documents lodged at Companies House mentioned how money had been used.

Found a whistleblower who had worked for Grossman on unrelated projects, but had been asked to send his invoices to Northamptonshire Council. Able to run a story on that, and that he had warned Mackintosh. Asked council if they knew - no.

Where did the £10,000 donations come from? Had a hypothesis they'd come from company. Go to the administrator, biggest creditor who has access to the accounts, ask if that money had gone through the accounts. A tiny fraction of their funding came from another source so couldn't definitively say the council money had paid for the election donations.

Relations within the local Conservative party having turned sour it was possible to speak to others who shared documents showing other payments - searched names on Companies House, Land Registry, and connected them with Grossman. These payments put amount over threshold for declarations.
