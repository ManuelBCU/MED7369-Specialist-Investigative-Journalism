# Company accounts: key points

Below are some of the key points to remember when dealing with company accounts in the UK.

## Company accounts: ingredients

Company accounts have many parts but broadly speaking there are three parts:

* **Reports/statements** - from directors, accountants, etc. These are normally quite dull or routine or attempt to mask the reality. However, occasionally people stray from the script and make controversial statements that can be newsworthy (such as a football chairman criticising the fans)
* **Cash flow** - this is what you expect from accounts: where money is going. Not only does this include obvious things like profit and loss but also trends (amounts going up or down), tax, problems (debt, costs) and clues (unusual payments)
* **Notes to the accounts** - you don't need to understand numbers to get stories from accounts. Many of the notes contain interesting nuggets that can be followed up or reported. The devil is also in the detail here when it comes to specifics about things like tax (what was actually paid, when factors were taken into account)

## Different types of company publish different amounts of information

* **Small companies** only have to publish abbreviated accounts
* **Medium** companies need to publish profit & loss (P&L), and a balance sheet
* **Listed** companies use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) so as to be comparable with others around the world. They will publish a lot more detail, particularly on things like remuneration of directors.
* **Large** companies can use IFRS or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UKGAAP) in the UK and publish more detail than a medium company
* **Charities** must also submit information to the Charity Commission, which publishes it too
* **Community Interest Companies** (CICs) "must prepare and deliver to Companies House a ‘community interest company report’ made up to the same date as the accounts" ([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#community-interest-companies-cics))
* **Dormant** companies are exempt from having an audit for that financial year. [More information on Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#dormant-company-accounts)
* **Micro-entity** companies are a subset of small companies, but "can prepare and file a balance sheet with a reduced set of information than that required by a small, medium or large company." ([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#micro-entity-accounts))
* **Self-employed** people are not companies. Although they file accounts they do not send them to Companies House. The main reason for setting up a limited company is that it provides a level of protection: if anything goes wrong the company might go into administration instead of the person losing their house or property.

## Where to look: Related party transactions

* At the end of the report
* Helps identify parent company, etc.
* Look out for licence payments etc. (tax avoidance? Wealth extraction?)
* Look out for missing info, e.g. relationships that should have been declared

## Where to look: Ultimate controlling party

Which company ultimately controls this one. May not be the same as owners. Who owns controlling voting shares, or combines to do so.

Look for: conflicts of interest, back-scratching.

## Where to look: Going concern

Does it expect to be able to operate for the next year (the “foreseeable future”)? Is this dependent upon support from parent company etc.?

**'Emphasis of matter'** indicates some doubt about future and involves assumptions (e.g. that loans will be renewed). Delayed accounts indicate attempts to avoid including these assumptions (get confirmation on loans first)
