# Company accounts - notes from CIJ Summer School 2018

> "Even when I leaked something to journalists they didn't understand it." - Raj

## Typical reasons for looking at accounts

* Company may be important local employer/contracts
* Director has political interest
* Doing well - why?
* Something odd about the activities of the company or director(s)
* The 'complex web'
* Equality: how much CEO makes compared to employees

## Motivations

Private companies:

* Depress 'earnings' to delay taxes
* Hide data from competitors and clients

Public companies:

* Enhance 'earnings' to increase share price (based on earnings per share - **EPS**)
* Directors own shares, so higher the value of shares the more their value
* Also get performance bonuses
* And stock options (to buy at fixed price)

Linking bosses' pay with share price was supposed to align interests with shareholders, but it was a "one way bet" - the shareholders can lose long-term but the bosses have already banked their benefits. And the managers set the terms of the incentive scheme, often low targets and short term.

Long Term Incentive Plans (**LTIP**) are supposed to replace these, but also being designed by managers.

Example: Persimmon introduced scheme in 2012 without a cap - institutional investors failed to spot this. Board shared £200m.

> "The payouts, in company shares that can then be cashed in, are linked to the FTSE 100 company’s dividend payments and stock market performance, which has been significantly boosted by the help-to-buy scheme. Under help to buy, the Treasury provides a loan worth 20% of the value of a property, although the buyer must also provide a 5% deposit from their own funds. The programme has provided a significant boost to property developers’ sales since George Osborne introduced it in 2013.

> "Persimmon’s share price has more than doubled since help to buy launched in April 2013. About half of Persimmon homes sold last year were to help-to-buy recipients, meaning government money helped finance the sales."

**'The number'**: target EPS, profit after tax divided by shares

Examples:

Enron, WorldCom, Ahold, Pamalat, Satyam, Anglo Irish Bank, Olympus, Tesco, Carillion

Company forecasts their own profit for the next year. Market reactions can be disproportionate, so fear of not declaring increasing profits leads to stories about 'cooked books' - "hitting the number".

**Material uncertainty**: GET NOTES FROM JONNY - margin of uncertainty allowed, 5%, 1% of profits etc.

## Cooking the books:

Two ways:

* Overstate **revenue** or
* Understate **cost of sales, expenses**

Leads to:

* **Assets** that do not exist/are overvalued
* **Liabilities** that are understated

Example: [letter from Satyam Chairman admitting inflated balance, non-declared borrowing, can be seen here](https://www.slideshare.net/guest69d931/satyam-the-letter-that-ramalinga-raju-wrote-reveals-shocking-details-presentation). More background [in this presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/ulhasw/satyam-fiasco-presentation-934980)

You can't report/spot the problem from the outside but you can be **sceptical**, and if things don't seem right that can spark questions ("Why is this being run differently? Why are they doing that?") and interviews in the sector - rival companies, etc.
