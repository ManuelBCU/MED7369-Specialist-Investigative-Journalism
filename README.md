# MED7369 Specialist Journalism, Investigations and Coding

This repo contains material for the module on the [MA in Data Journalism](http://bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism) and the [MA in Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/multiplatform-and-mobile-journalism-ma-2018-19) at Birmingham City University.

## Module synopsis

Within the context of media integration and convergence, *Specialist journalism, investigations and coding* aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to any chosen field of reporting. It also provides a basis for the successful completion of the masterâ€™s route project, and introduces potential avenues of practice-based inquiry for routes into PhD progression beyond. 

## Outcomes

1.	Identify, articulate and critically assess information sources, systems, and issues within an identified field of reporting. 
2.	Research and report stories in a specialist field using contemporary technologies for an identified audience 

## Week by week outline

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions, so you can make the most of the time in class.

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.
