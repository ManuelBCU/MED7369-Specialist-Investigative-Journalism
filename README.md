# MED7369 Specialist Journalism, Investigations and Coding

This repo contains material for the module which is studied as part of the [MA in Data Journalism](http://bcu.ac.uk/media/courses/data-journalism) and is an optional module on the [MA in Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/courses/multiplatform-and-mobile-journalism-ma-2018-19) at Birmingham City University.

## Module synopsis

Within the context of media integration and convergence, *Specialist journalism, investigations and coding* aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to any chosen field of reporting. It also provides a basis for the successful completion of the masterâ€™s route project, and introduces potential avenues of practice-based inquiry for routes into PhD progression beyond.

## Outcomes

1.	Identify, articulate and critically assess information sources, systems, and issues within an identified field of reporting.
2.	Research and report stories in a specialist field using contemporary technologies for an identified audience

## Week by week outline

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions, so you can make the most of the time in class.

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

### 1: Mapping the territory: specialist sources and systems

In this first week you will be introduced to exercises to help you identify potential stories to report when acting in a specialist or investigative role. We will look at the roles of systems in different fields and how those often play a central role as both a subject for the journalist, and a framework for their newsgathering. By the end of the week you should be able to identify a key issue in a chosen field, and articulate some potential avenues of inquiry.

* Directed study: Scoping document, data and human sources

### 2: Identifying and planning investigations and features

In this week you begin to narrow your focus to a specific story or 'hypothesis' to begin researching for an in-depth feature or investigation. By the end of the week you should be able to articulate your plan, including potential ingredients and specific contacts, locations and other elements in your story or stories.

* Workshop: planning your investigation or feature - [see network analysis folder](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/networkanalysis)

* Directed study: Project research and initial hypothesis

### 3: Follow the power: public admin, and accountability and measurement in specialist fields

This week looks at how you can use systems of accountability and measurement in your journalism, from the role of public meetings, documents and data, the role of regulators, and legal powers such as FOI. By the end of this week you should be able to describe specific systems in your area of interest that you can use in your reporting.

* Workshop: reporting political stories

* Directed study: Interview planning and research

### 4: Coding for journalists

This week introduces you to basic coding techniques and applies those to a useful source of information: APIs. By the end of this week you should be able to identify opportunities for using coding in your field, and explain basic coding concepts such as variables, loops, functions and libraries.

* [Folder for this week](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/python)
* Workshop: Reporting crime, environment or food using APIs - [see Python folder](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/python)
* Read: Bradshaw, P (2015) [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists), Leanpub
* Directed study: Gathering data and FOIs

### 5: Information problems

This week builds on basic coding techniques and applies those to a useful information gathering technique: scraping. By the end of this week you should be able to identify opportunities for scraping, including more APIs which provide or can complement data in your field.

* Workshop: Python, scraping and APIs - [see Python folder](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/python)
* Read: Shaw, Zed A. (2013) [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
* Directed study: Compiling/analysing data

### 6: Cleaning and converting information

Information doesn't often come in the perfect format to ask questions. This week you learn some techniques for making it more amenable to analysis - 'cleaning'. By the end of the week you should be able to identify common data problems and use basic techniques for tackling those.

* [Folder for this week](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/cleaning)
* Workshop: reporting health using Open Refine
* Read: Verborgh and DeWilde (2013) Using Open Refine, Packt
* Directed study: Compiling/cleaning data

### 7: Statistics for journalists

Statistical literacy is important in being able to report stories accurately. In this week we focus on some common statistical issues as well as techniques for using statistical methods in your own reporting. By the end of the week you should be able to articulate basic statistical concepts and undertake basic statistical analysis.

* Workshop: reporting education
* Read: Huff, Darrell (1954) How to Lie With Statistics, Penguin
* Directed study: Data analysis/interview planning and research

### 8: Following the money: accounts

Company accounts are an excellent source of news stories, and a key resource in many investigations and features. This week we explore techniques for getting stories from company accounts, and story ideas that can draw on accounts. By the end of the week you should be able to identify and report stories from company accounts.

* [Folder for this week](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/accounts)

* Directed study: Accounts research/interview planning and research

### 9: Immersive storytelling

Telling an in-depth story presents particular challenges in terms of selecting, organising and combining elements. This week is devoted to exploring those techniques with regard to your own stories. By the end of the week you should have a broad outline of your story and the elements needed to complete it, and tell it.

* Workshop: story development
